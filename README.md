# SemanticPDF: Drag, Drop, Semantic Search

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

SemanticPDF is a simple, privacy-focused application that makes it easy to upload a PDF file and perform a semantic search on contents. With a simple drag-and-drop interface, SemanticPDF makes it effortless to search through a file intelligently when an exact keyword search is lacking. For instance, searching through a book for "the author's opinion on the future of artificial intelligence" or locating sections in an economics research paper that speak to "the long term impact" of the studied topic.
